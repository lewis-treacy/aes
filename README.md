# AES
This is a rudimentary implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) according to ISO-18033:2010. This project was intended to help me learn some go and have a bit of fun researching AES.

This is by all means not a perfect implementation of AES, just a fun little project. See the crypto/aes package for a professional implementation.
